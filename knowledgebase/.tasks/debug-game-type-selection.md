# ðŸš€ Cline Task Prompt: Debug Game Type Selection on Onboarding Screen

## **Objective:**
Troubleshoot and fix the issue where users can no longer select a game type during onboarding. This bug appeared after the CSV caching integration. Ensure consistency with the existing technical stack and avoid introducing new frameworks like Vue, as it was mistakenly added during previous work despite not being part of the project.

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 1: Debugging the Issue**

### **Task 1: Investigate Game Type Selection Failure**
- Review the most recent changes related to the CSV caching implementation.
- Identify why the game type selection no longer works.
- Confirm whether the issue is caused by:
   - Data not being correctly loaded from the cache.
   - Event handlers or bindings being broken.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Root cause of the bug is identified and documented.
- [ ] The selection state is restored and functional.

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 2: Code Consistency and Technical Alignment**

### **Task 2: Ensure Consistency with Existing Stack**
- Confirm the existing frontend framework used in the project (React).
- Remove any accidental usage of **Vue.js** introduced during CSV caching integration.
- Align with existing project patterns for:
   - State Management
   - Component Structure
   - Event Handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Vue-related code removed and replaced with the correct React patterns.
- [ ] Code matches the existing architecture of the project.

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance**

### **Task 3: Test the Fixes**
- Test the game type selection for:
   - Clicking multiple categories.
   - Deselecting categories.
   - Smooth data loading from the CSV cache.
- Confirm no regressions in other parts of the onboarding flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Game type selection functions as expected.
- [ ] No regressions in the onboarding flow.

---

## âœ… **General Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The game type selection bug is resolved.
- [ ] The codebase remains consistent with the existing technical stack (React).

---

## ðŸ“– **Documentation and Commit Message:**
- **Commit Message:** "Fixed onboarding game type selection issue. Removed Vue and ensured React consistency."
- **Knowledgebase Update:** Add a note about the caching approach and the corrected technical stack usage.
