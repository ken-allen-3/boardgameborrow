# ðŸš€ Cline Task Prompt: Fix Quick Add Game Display Issues

## **Objective:**
Resolve the issues on the **Quick Add** step where:
1. **Game images and metadata (player count, playtime)** are not displaying correctly.
2. The layout is not using the requested **off-canvas horizontal scrolling** approach.

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 1: Fix Missing Game Data Issue**

### **Task 1: Ensure Proper Data Binding**
- Investigate why game images, player count, and playtime are showing as `N/A`.
- Confirm that the cached data includes these fields and is properly linked to the game cards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All game cards display images, player count, and playtime.

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 2: Correct Layout for Off-Canvas Horizontal Scroll**

### **Task 2: Implement Horizontal Scrolling**
- Adjust the **Quick Add** layout to display horizontally scrollable rows for each category, as previously requested.
- Ensure the design matches the wireframe with **separate horizontal sections** for each game type (e.g., Family, Party).

**Key Adjustments:**
- Use **CSS flexbox** with `flex-nowrap` and `overflow-x: auto`.
- Apply **scroll snap behavior** for better user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Each game type section scrolls horizontally.
- [ ] Cards remain vertically listed within their scroll rows.
- [ ] Consistent styling across mobile and desktop views.
