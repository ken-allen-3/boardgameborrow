# Task: Enhance Onboarding Progress Visualization

## Objective
Improve the visual feedback and navigation of the onboarding flow by implementing a more intuitive and informative progress system.

## Requirements

### Progress Bar/Stepper Implementation
- [ ] Add a horizontal stepper component at the top of the onboarding flow
- [ ] Display all steps with their names (Welcome, Game Types, Quick Add, Location, Complete)
- [ ] Highlight current step with distinct styling
- [ ] Show completed steps with checkmark icons
- [ ] Add subtle animations for step transitions

### Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Implement progress percentage indicator
- [ ] Add micro-animations for step completion
- [ ] Create smooth transitions between steps
- [ ] Design mobile-responsive progress visualization

### Navigation Improvements
- [ ] Add previous/next step buttons with appropriate styling
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation (left/right arrows)
- [ ] Show step preview on hover/focus
- [ ] Add progress persistence across sessions

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure smooth animations (use CSS transitions)
- Handle edge cases (first/last step)
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Consider mobile touch interactions

## Implementation Steps
1. Create ProgressStepper component
2. Implement step tracking logic
3. Add animations and transitions
4. Integrate with existing onboarding flow
5. Add persistence layer
6. Test across devices and browsers

## Success Criteria
- Users can easily understand their progress
- Navigation between steps is intuitive
- Progress visualization works on all screen sizes
- Animations are smooth and performant
- Accessibility requirements are met
