# Board Game Borrow Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This knowledge base centralizes all technical and operational knowledge for the BoardGameBorrow project, ensuring consistency and clarity across development.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

1. **Start Here**: Review the [technical_architecture.md](docs/technical_architecture.md) to understand the overall system.
2. **Development Steps**: Follow the [developer_instructions.md](docs/developer_instructions.md) for task breakdown and step-by-step guidance.
3. **APIs & Data**: Check [api_integrations.md](docs/api_integrations.md) and [data_modeling.md](docs/data_modeling.md) for handling backend integrations and database setups.
4. **Contributions**: Use the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn how to submit documentation updates.

## Visual Aids
Diagrams, architecture flowcharts, and system models are stored in the `/assets/` directory.

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation modular and up-to-date
- Use Markdown for consistency
- Reference the CHANGELOG.md for all major documentation updates

## Future Migration: Moving to Google Drive

Should the knowledge base transition to Google Drive in the future:
1. Maintain the same folder structure for consistency
2. Convert Markdown files to Google Docs
3. Share appropriate permissions and ensure restricted access for sensitive data

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Technical Architecture](docs/technical_architecture.md) for a high-level overview
2. Review the [Onboarding Implementation](docs/onboarding_implementation.md) for user flow details
3. Follow [Developer Instructions](docs/developer_instructions.md) for setup and development
