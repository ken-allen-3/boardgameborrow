# Feature Roadmap Implementation

## Overview
A lightweight feature tracking system that allows users to view, vote on, and submit feature requests/bug reports, while providing easy management capabilities for administrators through both web interface and VSCode/Cline integration.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```typescript
interface RoadmapCard {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'planned' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  votes: {
    up: number;
    down: number;
    userVotes: Record<string, 'up' | 'down'>;  // Track individual user votes
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;  // User ID
  priority: number;   // Calculated from votes
  tags: string[];     // e.g., 'bug', 'feature', 'enhancement'
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### Core Components
- `FeatureRoadmap.tsx`: Main page component
  - Manages overall board layout
  - Handles data fetching and state management
  - Implements drag-and-drop for admin card management

- `RoadmapColumn.tsx`: Status column component
  - Displays cards filtered by status
  - Handles card sorting (by votes, date, priority)
  - Implements column-specific loading states

- `RoadmapCard.tsx`: Feature/bug card component
  - Displays card information
  - Handles voting interactions
  - Shows vote counts and user's vote status
  - Implements edit/delete for admin users

- `NewFeatureModal.tsx`: Submission form
  - Form for new feature/bug submission
  - Field validation
  - Tag selection
  - Preview capability

### User Features

#### Viewing & Interaction
- Board view with status columns (Planned/In Progress/Completed)
- Card voting (up/down) with visual feedback
- Feature/bug submission form
- Filtering and sorting options:
  - By status
  - By vote count
  - By date
  - By tags

#### Submission Process
1. User clicks "Submit Feature" button
2. Modal opens with form fields:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Type (feature/bug)
   - Tags
3. Form validation ensures quality submissions
4. Submission creates new card in "Planned" status

### Admin Features

#### Web Interface
- Drag-and-drop card management between status columns
- Edit card details (title, description, status)
- Delete cards
- Pin/prioritize important cards
- Bulk actions for multiple cards

#### VSCode/Cline Integration
- Command palette actions:
  - Create new card
  - Update card status
  - Move cards between columns
- Quick card creation from current file/line
- Direct Firebase document manipulation

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Firebase collections and security rules
- [ ] Implement basic board layout and card display
- [ ] Create card management service
- [ ] Add basic CRUD operations

#### Phase 2: User Features
- [ ] Implement voting system
- [ ] Add user submission form
- [ ] Create filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile

#### Phase 3: Admin Features
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop card management
- [ ] Implement admin controls
- [ ] Create VSCode/Cline integration
- [ ] Add analytics/metrics tracking

### Security Considerations
- Firebase security rules to protect voting integrity
- Admin-only access for status changes
- Rate limiting for submissions
- Validation for all user inputs

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement pagination for large card sets
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching
- Optimize real-time updates
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Future Enhancements
- Comment system on cards
- Rich text descriptions
- Image attachments
- Integration with GitHub issues
- Email notifications for card updates
- Advanced analytics dashboard
