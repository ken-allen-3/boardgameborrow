# Horizontal Scroll Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of horizontal scrolling in the Borrow Games page and other components that use similar scrolling behavior.

## Implementation Details

### Container Styling
The horizontal scroll container uses the following Tailwind CSS classes:
```css
flex overflow-x-auto gap-4 pb-4 snap-x snap-mandatory
```

- `flex`: Creates a flex container
- `overflow-x-auto`: Enables horizontal scrolling
- `gap-4`: Adds spacing between items
- `pb-4`: Adds bottom padding to account for potential scrollbar
- `snap-x`: Enables horizontal scroll snapping
- `snap-mandatory`: Makes snap points mandatory

### Card Styling
Game cards within the scroll container use:
```css
min-w-[300px] snap-center
```

- `min-w-[300px]`: Sets a consistent minimum width for cards
- `snap-center`: Aligns cards to the center when snapping

## Usage

### Page Implementations

#### Quick Add Step
The onboarding Quick Add step uses the same horizontal scroll layout and card design:
- Consistent card styling across all game sections
- 4:3 aspect ratio for images
- Icon-based metadata display
- Added selection state with blue ring indicator

#### Borrow Games Page
The horizontal scroll layout is implemented in four main sections:
1. My Borrow Requests
2. Friends' Games
3. Games Near You
4. All Games (Popular)

Each section maintains consistent scrolling behavior while preserving the content hierarchy.

#### MyGames Page
The game list has been updated to use the same horizontal scrolling layout:
- Single scrollable row of games
- Consistent card sizing with Borrow Games page
- Preserved functionality for game management (delete, rate, status)

### Card Design
The game card design has been updated to match the MyGames page style while maintaining a compact size suitable for horizontal scrolling:
- 4:3 aspect ratio for images
- Icon-based metadata display
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Preserved functionality for borrow requests

## Best Practices
1. Always include snap points for smooth scrolling experience
2. Maintain consistent card widths to ensure predictable scrolling
3. Use padding and gaps appropriately to handle overflow and spacing
4. Consider mobile-first design with appropriate touch targets
