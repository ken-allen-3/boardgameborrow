# üéØ BoardGameBorrow Onboarding Vision Document

## **Objective:**
This document defines the desired state of the redesigned onboarding experience for the BoardGameBorrow application. The goal is to create a streamlined, intuitive, and engaging onboarding flow that:

- Welcomes new users and explains the platform‚Äôs value clearly.
- Guides users through essential setup steps.
- Encourages immediate interaction with the platform‚Äôs core features.

---

## **End-Goal Summary:**
The onboarding process will consist of a **six-step modular flow:**

1. **Welcome & Value Introduction:** Briefly introduce the platform's value for different user types.
2. **Account Setup:** Collect user information (Name, Location, Profile Picture).
3. **Add Your First Game:** Provide both a photo-scanning tool and manual entry option.
4. **Connect with Friends & Groups:** Encourage inviting friends and joining local groups.
5. **Explore Game Nights & Borrow Games:** Introduce the game library and event discovery features.
6. **Completion & Encouragement:** Celebrate onboarding completion and suggest next actions.

---

## **Key Design Principles:**
- **Clarity:** Minimize cognitive load with focused screens and tooltips.
- **Modular Flow:** Each step will be its own component, with progress visibility.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensure accessibility with readable fonts, color contrast, and clear language.
- **Engagement:** Use positive reinforcement (confetti animations, progress bars).

---

## **User Personas and Alignment:**
The onboarding flow should meet the needs of the following personas:

- **Casual Gamers:** Focus on quick game access and sharing.
- **Game Collectors:** Showcase collections and highlight game sharing.
- **Community Builders:** Emphasize social tools like friend invitations and event creation.
- **Minimalists:** Highlight the benefits of borrowing instead of collecting.

---

## **Differences from Current Setup:**
### ‚úÖ What Stays:
- Firebase for authentication and data storage.
- React Context for global state (`AuthContext`).

### ‚ùå What Changes:
- Replace **TutorialProvider.tsx** and modal-based steps with a more linear, modular flow.
- Update `Step3AddGame.tsx` with a dual-option for scanning and manual input.
- Revise copy and microcopy for clarity and alignment with user personas.

### üõ†Ô∏è **What Gets Removed:**
- Old tutorial overlays (`TutorialProvider` and `TutorialStep`).

---

## **Feature List for Completion:**
- **Progress Tracking:** Progress bar across the top for step visibility.
- **Clear CTAs:** Distinct ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù buttons.
- **Error Handling:** Inline validation for forms.
- **Confetti Animation:** At the final step to celebrate completion.

---

## **Next Steps:**
- Add this document to the `/knowledgebase/docs` folder.
- Reference this document when creating new tasks for Cline.
- Ensure all tasks in `developer_instructions.md` align with this vision.

This document ensures that Cline and any other contributors have a unified understanding of the desired onboarding flow for the project.
