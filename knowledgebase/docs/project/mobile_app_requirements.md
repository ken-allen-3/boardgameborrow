### **Assumptions**
1. The web app’s backend services (Firebase, BGG API integrations) are stable and reusable for the mobile app.
2. Notifications will be sent using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
3. The mobile app will follow the same design principles as the web app for consistency.

---

### **Constraints**
1. Limited team resources may require prioritization of features for the initial release.
2. Adherence to App Store and Google Play guidelines may limit certain functionalities.
3. Offline functionality will depend on the availability of Firebase’s offline persistence.

---

### **Risks**
1. Potential API rate limits during high traffic periods.
2. Challenges in ensuring seamless offline/online transitions.
3. Delays in App Store and Google Play approvals.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Finalize feature priorities for the initial release.
2. Begin technical design and UI prototyping.
3. Allocate resources for Firebase configuration and API testing.
