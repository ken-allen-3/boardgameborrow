### **Technical Design Document: BoardGameBorrow Mobile App**

---

#### **Overview**
This document provides a detailed technical blueprint for the development of the BoardGameBorrow mobile app, focusing on architecture, data flow, and integration points to ensure seamless functionality across iOS, Android, and the existing web platform.

---

### **1. Architecture**

#### **1.1 Platform**
- **Framework:** React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform development.
- **Backend:** Firebase for authentication, real-time database, and push notifications.
- **API Integration:** BoardGameGeek API for game data retrieval.

#### **1.2 Core Components**
1. **Frontend:**
   - Shared React components adapted for mobile.
   - Navigation via **React Navigation** for stack and tab-based routing.
   - TailwindCSS for styling (via `tailwind-rn` for React Native).

2. **Backend:**
   - Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic.
   - Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and sync.
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.

3. **Offline Support:**
   - Firebase offline persistence for game library and cache.
   - Local storage fallback for temporary data persistence.

---

### **2. Data Flow**

#### **2.1 User Authentication**
1. **Sign In/Sign Up Flow:**
   - User authenticates using Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google, or Facebook).
   - Authentication tokens are securely stored using `AsyncStorage`.

2. **Session Management:**
   - Persistent sessions maintained via Firebase tokens.
   - Token refresh handled by Firebase SDK.

#### **2.2 Game Library**
1. **Fetching Data:**
   - Game data fetched from Firebase Realtime Database (primary) or BoardGameGeek API (secondary if uncached).

2. **Adding Games:**
   - Search/Add Feature: User searches or uploads a photo to add a game to their library.
   - Data stored in `/game-libraries/{userId}` in Firebase.

3. **Offline Mode:**
   - Cached game data served when offline.
   - Offline changes synced with Firebase upon reconnecting.

#### **2.3 Notifications**
- Push notifications sent via Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- Notification types:
  - Game night updates.
  - Friend requests.
  - App announcements.

---

### **3. Key Integration Points**

#### **3.1 Firebase Integration**
1. **Authentication:**
   - User management.
   - Social login.

2. **Realtime Database:**
   - Game libraries and user profiles.
   - Real-time updates for game night changes.

3. **Cloud Messaging:**
   - Push notifications for event-driven updates.

#### **3.2 BoardGameGeek API**
- Game search and metadata retrieval.
- Rate-limit handling with caching to reduce API dependency.

#### **3.3 AI/Photo-Vision Service**
- Image recognition for identifying games.
- Results processed via Firebase Cloud Functions.

---

### **4. Technology Stack**

#### **4.1 Frontend**
- **React Native**: Cross-platform development.
- **React Navigation**: Navigation and routing.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development.
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling.

#### **4.2 Backend**
- **Firebase Services:**
  - Authentication.
  - Realtime Database.
  - Cloud Functions.
  - Cloud Messaging.

#### **4.3 Libraries/Tools**
- `axios`: HTTP requests.
- `redux-toolkit` or React Context: State management.
- `tailwind-rn`: Styling.
- `AsyncStorage`: Local data storage for React Native.

---

### **5. Deployment Strategy**

#### **5.1 Development Stages**
1. **Prototype:**
   - Implement core features (authentication, game library).
   - Test basic navigation and offline functionality.

2. **Beta:**
   - Enable push notifications.
   - Add AI/photo-vision support.
   - Conduct user testing.

3. **Production:**
   - Optimize for performance.
   - Deploy to App Store and Google Play.

#### **5.2 Deployment Steps**
1. **iOS:**
   - Configure Xcode for app signing and distribution.
   - Submit to TestFlight for beta testing.
   - Deploy to App Store.

2. **Android:**
   - Generate signed APK/AAB.
   - Submit to Google Play Console for testing and production release.

---

### **6. Security Considerations**
1. Encrypt all sensitive data in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
2. Use Firebase security rules to restrict unauthorized access.
3. Securely store authentication tokens using `SecureStorage` or `AsyncStorage`.

---

### **7. Risks and Mitigation**
1. **API Rate Limits:**
   - Use caching to minimize API calls.
   - Implement fallback strategies for frequent queries.

2. **Offline Sync Issues:**
   - Thoroughly test edge cases for data sync conflicts.

3. **App Store/Google Play Delays:**
   - Plan buffer time for app review processes.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Set up the React Native project and Firebase configuration.
2. Develop and test the core features.
3. Prepare for beta testing by configuring notifications and user feedback mechanisms.
