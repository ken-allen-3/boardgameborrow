### **Project Scope Document: BoardGameBorrow Mobile App**

---

#### **Project Overview**
BoardGameBorrow aims to enhance its user experience by developing a mobile app for iOS and Android that complements the existing web app. The mobile app will allow users to access key features such as browsing and managing their game library, searching for new games, and organizing game nights seamlessly on their smartphones.

---

#### **Project Objectives**
1. Expand platform accessibility by creating a mobile app compatible with iOS and Android.
2. Maintain feature parity with the web app for core functionality while optimizing for mobile user experience.
3. Leverage shared codebases and Firebase backend to ensure consistency and reduce development time.
4. Provide offline functionality and push notifications to improve user engagement.

---

#### **Deliverables**
1. A React Native-based mobile app available on both iOS and Android platforms.
2. Core features implemented in the app:
   - Game library browsing and management.
   - Search and add games (including BGG API integration).
   - Notifications for game night updates and friend requests.
   - Offline support for cached game data.
3. Firebase integration for authentication, real-time data sync, and push notifications.
4. App deployment to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

---

#### **Scope**
**In-Scope:**
- Development of a React Native app sharing business logic with the web app.
- Adaptation of UI components for mobile screen sizes and interactions.
- Integration with Firebase for backend operations, including real-time sync and offline persistence.
- Testing and deployment for iOS and Android platforms.
- Basic analytics and performance monitoring via Firebase.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Advanced features planned for future phases, such as:
  - Social activity feeds.
  - Recommendation systems.
- Custom native modules beyond React Native’s capabilities.
- Support for older device OS versions (e.g., iOS versions below 13 or Android below 8).

---

#### **Assumptions**
1. React Native will be used to maximize code sharing between web and mobile platforms.
2. Firebase backend services (Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Functions) are already in place and require minimal changes for mobile.
3. Apple Developer Program and Google Play Console accounts are active and configured for app submission.
4. Initial launch will target modern iOS and Android versions.

---

#### **Constraints**
1. Limited team resources may require prioritization of features for the initial release.
2. App Store and Google Play submission processes may introduce delays in deployment timelines.
3. Dependencies on the web app’s shared services and APIs must be stable and compatible with mobile use cases.

---

#### **Risks**
1. Potential delays in adapting existing components to mobile interfaces.
2. API rate limits from the BGG API impacting real-time features.
3. Challenges in ensuring feature parity and seamless data sync across platforms.
4. User adoption and feedback may necessitate rapid post-launch updates.

---

#### **Timeline**
**Estimated Development Time:** 6–8 weeks for the first functional release.
**Post-Beta Optimization:** 2–3 weeks based on user feedback.

---

#### **Stakeholders**
1. Product Team: Define app features and oversee development.
2. Development Team: Build and test the app.
3. QA Team: Validate app functionality and performance.
4. Users: Provide feedback during beta testing and post-launch.
