# ðŸš€ Cline Task Prompt: Add Error Logging for Debugging Game Type Selection Issue

## **Objective:**
Enhance the debugging process by implementing comprehensive error logging to identify why the game type selection is still not functioning properly after the last attempted fix.

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 1: Add Console Logging for Key Actions**

### **Task 1: Implement Console Logs**
- Add `console.log()` statements to:
   - **Component Mounting:** Ensure the component initializes correctly.
   - **Data Fetching:** Confirm when the CSV cache is accessed and if data loads successfully.
   - **User Interaction:** Log game type selection clicks and changes in state.
- Ensure logs include:
   - Clear descriptions of the logged action.
   - Relevant variable values (e.g., selected game types, fetched game data).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Console logs are added for component mounting, data fetching, and user interactions.

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 2: Implement Error Handling Logs**

### **Task 2: Add Try/Catch Blocks with Error Logging**
- Wrap critical code blocks in `try...catch` statements.
- Log detailed error messages when exceptions occur.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Errors are logged with helpful messages and stack traces.
- [ ] Error messages identify the specific component and function where the error occurred.

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Phase 3: Verify Logging Effectiveness**

### **Task 3: Test Logging Behavior**
- Trigger the game type selection multiple times and verify:
   - Logs appear at the correct moments.
   - No silent failures.
- Ensure no performance issues are introduced by excessive logging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All key actions and errors are logged.
- [ ] No noticeable performance degradation.

---

## âœ… **General Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Logging provides useful data for further debugging.
- [ ] No regressions or new bugs introduced.

---

## ðŸ“– **Documentation and Commit Message:**
- **Commit Message:** "Added comprehensive error logging for debugging game type selection issue."
- **Knowledgebase Update:** Document error handling and logging strategy.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Technical Notes:**
- **Components to Update:**
   - `/components/onboarding/StepGameTypes.tsx`
   - `/services/gameDataService.ts`
- **Ensure:**
   - Proper use of `console.log` and `try...catch`
   - Logs do not expose sensitive data.
